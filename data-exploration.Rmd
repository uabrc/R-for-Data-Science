This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



Load the directory with your R packages:
```{r}
.libPaths('/data/user/ravi89/R_3.6.2/')
```


The following commands should install tidyverse package in your environment, and then load it.
```{r}
#install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
```



#Visualising distributions
A variable is categorical if it can only take one of a small set of values. In R, categorical variables are usually saved as factors or character vectors. To examine the distribution of a categorical variable, use a bar chart:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

You can count the number of observations for every cut by using count method

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut)
```



A variable is continuous if it can take any of an infinite set of ordered values. Numbers and date-times are two examples of continuous variables. To examine the distribution of a continuous variable, use a histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```


Again to count the observations for a range in continuous variable, you can use count method:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut_width(carat, 0.5))
```


To choose a smaller binwidth, and with a criteria of less than 3 carat, we can modify our histogram as follows:

```{r}
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat < 3)
  
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)
```


To overlay multiple histograms, and/or to get a more continuous feel in your histogram you can use freqpoly rather then histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, colour = cut)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1)
```



# Typical values

As the name suggests, we can try to ascertain typical values in a distribution by lowering our binwidth in histograms.

Lowering the binwidth to 0.01 for diamond dataset, gives us following questions, in the process of data exploration:
* As an example, the histogram below suggests several interesting questions:

* Why are there more diamonds at whole carats and common fractions of carats?

* Why are there more diamonds slightly to the right of each peak than there are slightly to the left of each peak?

* 
Why are there no diamonds bigger than 3 carats?

```{r}
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```



Similarly, we can take a look at Old Faithful Geyser dataset, to see the frequency of eruptions:

```{r}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = eruptions)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25)
```


Eruption times appear to be clustered into two groups: there are short eruptions (of around 2 minutes) and long eruptions (4-5 minutes), but little in between.


# Unusual values

Outliers are observations that are unusual; data points that donâ€™t seem to fit the pattern. Sometimes outliers are data entry errors; other times outliers suggest important new science. 
When you have a lot of data, outliers are sometimes difficult to see in a histogram.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5)
```


Now, we have so much data that we can't see outliers, as typically they would be less in number, so we can zoom in to y axis to see those outliers:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))
```


Let's see those values using dplyr:

```{r}
unusual <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(y < 3 | y > 20) %>% 
  select(price, x, y, z) %>%
  arrange(y)
unusual
```
